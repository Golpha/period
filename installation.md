# Installation

## System Requirements

You need **PHP >= 5.3.0** to use `Period` but the latest stable version of PHP is recommended.

## Composer

`Period` is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/league/period) and can be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

~~~json
{
    "require": {
        "league/period": "2.*"
    }
}
~~~

## Going Solo

You can also use `Period` without using Composer by downloading the library and using any other [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compatible autoloader.
