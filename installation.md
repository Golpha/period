# Installation

## System Requirements

`Period` requires **PHP 5.5.0** or **HHVM 3.4.0** but the latest stable version is recommended.

## Composer

`Period` is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/league/period) and can be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

~~~bash
$ composer require league/period
~~~

## Going Solo

You can also use `Period` without using Composer by downloading the library and using any other [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compatible autoloader.
