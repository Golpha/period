Period is PHP missing Time Range class. It is based on [Resolving Feature Envy in the Domain](http://verraes.net/2014/08/resolving-feature-envy-in-the-domain/) by Mathias Verraes and extends the concept to cover all basic operations regarding time ranges.

## Highlights

- Treats time range as immutable value objects
- Exposes many named constructors to ease time range creation
- Covers all basic manipulations related to time range
- Fully documented
- Framework-agnostic, will work with any project
- Composer ready, [PSR-2], and [PSR-4] compliant
